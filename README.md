# No More 30% Fees! Recommend 8 Commission-Free Ordering Game-Changers!

Watching DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub siphon 25-30% from every order while simultaneously selling your customer data to promote competitors creates the restaurant industry's most infuriating profit drain. Third-party marketplaces position themselves as necessary evils—you need their reach but hate seeing $300 orders shrink to $210 after platform fees, plus they own the customer relationship meaning patrons reorder through the app rather than calling you directly. Commission-free restaurant online ordering systems eliminate this parasitic dynamic by letting you take orders through your own branded website and app, keeping 100% of revenue, maintaining direct customer relationships for retention and marketing, and often costing less monthly than a single day's third-party commission losses. Whether you're a single location tired of bleeding profits or a multi-unit operation losing $10,000+ monthly to marketplace fees, these platforms deliver the ordering technology without the exploitative pricing models that make third-party apps rich while restaurants struggle.

## **[OrderDive](https://get.orderdive.com)**

Zero-commission ordering with instant menu updates, automated scheduling, and thermal printing for $139 monthly.

![OrderDive Screenshot](/get.webp)


OrderDive attacks the restaurant industry's biggest pain point head-on—the 30% commission third-party marketplaces extract from every order while simultaneously undermining your business by promoting competitors. The platform's core value proposition is brutally simple: keep 100% of every order instead of watching a third of your revenue disappear to DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Grubhub shareholders.

The self-service dashboard provides instant control over menu management without requiring calls to account executives for every change. When you run out of ribeye steaks at 7PM on Saturday, you immediately 86 the item through the dashboard rather than frantically calling someone who might respond in 20 minutes after dozens of angry customers already ordered unavailable items. This real-time control matters tremendously during high-volume service when menu availability changes minute-by-minute.

Automated scheduling and timeslot management put pickup and delivery coordination on autopilot. The system manages capacity, preventing the overwhelming scenario where 47 orders come in for 6:30PM pickup when your kitchen can realistically prepare 20 orders in that window. Rate limiting protects kitchen operations from crushing order volumes that destroy food quality and staff morale when promises can't be kept.

Server-side rendering maximizes organic search visibility, helping customers discover your ordering site through Google rather than exclusively through expensive third-party platforms. This SEO optimization builds long-term direct ordering relationships rather than perpetually renting customers from marketplaces that view you as interchangeable with competitors.

The frictionless menu and checkout experience lets customers customize orders with single taps rather than cumbersome multi-step processes frustrating users into abandoning carts. The architecture prioritizes speed—customers never wait watching loading spinners while building orders. This technical performance matters because every second of delay statistically increases cart abandonment rates.

Pricing at $139 monthly when billed annually includes unlimited commission-free orders, fully customized branding, automated scheduling, free menu upload, pickup/catering/delivery support, and unlimited cloud dashboard access. The platform offers complete free access until you're ready to go live, letting you build and test your ordering system without upfront investment. Optional thermal printer hardware costs $249.99 one-time for 80mm auto-cut encrypted printing without requiring tablets, PCs, or driver installations.

## **[ChowNow](https://get.chownow.com)**

Branded website and mobile apps with marketing tools starting $139 monthly for independent restaurant focus.

![ChowNow Screenshot](/get.webp)


ChowNow built its reputation specifically serving independent restaurants fighting against corporate chain advantages and third-party marketplace exploitation. The platform provides branded websites and native iOS/Android mobile apps putting your restaurant identity front-and-center rather than burying you inside generic marketplace interfaces where customers see five competitors simultaneously.

Marketing tool integration drives repeat business through email campaigns, social media integrations, and customer engagement features helping you build relationships rather than just transactional ordering. The platform recognizes that sustainable restaurant success requires loyal customer bases, not just one-time orders from marketplace browsers who might never return.

Order tracking and notifications keep customers informed throughout preparation and delivery, reducing the "where's my food?" calls that consume staff time during busy service. The transparency creates confidence and reduces anxiety—customers see exactly when orders will arrive rather than wondering if they were forgotten.

Loyalty program integration rewards repeat customers, creating incentive structures encouraging direct ordering over third-party platforms. When customers accumulate points or discounts through direct orders but not through DoorDash, they logically shift ordering behavior toward more profitable direct channels over time.

Reporting and analytics provide visibility into ordering patterns, popular items, peak times, and customer behavior informing menu optimization and operational decisions. You discover that 60% of delivery orders happen between 6-8PM Fridays, letting you staff appropriately rather than guessing or overstaffing unprofitable hours.

Pricing starts at $119 monthly for restaurants generating $20,000 or less in monthly online ordering revenue, with costs scaling for higher-volume operations. The tiered structure makes the platform accessible for smaller operations while accommodating growth without forcing platform switches as business expands.

## **[BentoBox](https://www.getbento.com)**

Design-first ordering platform with responsive support and automated marketing from $79 monthly per location.

![BentoBox Screenshot](/getbento.webp)


BentoBox differentiates through design-first philosophy keeping restaurant branding and identity central throughout the ordering experience from first click through checkout to order updates. The platform understands that dining represents lifestyle and aesthetic choices—customers don't just want food, they want experiences aligning with personal identity and values your brand communicates.

The responsive support team maintains reputation as the most helpful in the industry, providing assistance that actually solves problems rather than scripted responses deflecting to knowledge bases. When technical issues or questions arise during critical service periods, reaching competent humans who care makes the difference between minor hiccups and operational disasters.

Bento Ordering empowers restaurants to capture direct pickup and delivery orders through existing websites or BentoBox-powered sites, recognizing that 70% of consumers prefer ordering directly from restaurants rather than through third-party marketplaces when convenient options exist. This customer preference creates opportunity—you just need infrastructure meeting convenience expectations.

Commission bypass saves restaurants from 30%+ third-party marketplace fees that destroy profit margins on delivery orders. A $50 order generating $15 in marketplace fees leaves minimal profit after food costs, labor, and overhead. That same order through Bento Ordering keeps the full $50, transforming marginally profitable delivery into genuinely valuable revenue.

Multi-location scaling accommodates restaurant groups managing several locations without requiring separate systems or fragmented dashboards. Centralized management combined with location-specific customization balances operational efficiency with local market adaptability.

Automated marketing campaigns and customer loyalty programs drive repeat orders without requiring manual campaign management. The platform automatically sends strategic communications—abandoned cart reminders, reorder suggestions based on past favorites, special occasion promotions—creating touchpoints that increase customer lifetime value.

Pricing at $79 monthly for the first location (or $49 monthly as add-on to existing BentoBox websites) positions the platform as accessible premium solution delivering professional results without enterprise-level investments.

## **[UpMenu](https://www.upmenu.com)**

Commission-free platform with 40+ website themes, branded mobile apps, and automated marketing from $49 monthly.

![UpMenu Screenshot](/upmenu.webp)


UpMenu emphasizes commission-free ordering combined with extensive website customization options and included branded mobile apps, letting restaurants build strong brand identities while avoiding fee structures bleeding profits. The 40+ website themes accommodate diverse restaurant aesthetics from fine dining elegance to casual counter-service simplicity without requiring custom design expertise.

The branded mobile app inclusion provides iOS and Android presence enhancing brand recognition and customer convenience. Apps living on customer phones maintain visibility between orders, creating consistent reminders and touchpoints that third-party marketplaces lack—when hunger strikes, your app icon stares at them rather than requiring conscious decisions to seek out your restaurant.

Menu management and customization tools let you adapt offerings, adjust prices, add seasonal specials, or remove out-of-stock items instantly. This real-time control prevents customer frustration from ordering unavailable items and lets you respond dynamically to supply chain issues or spontaneous ingredient availability.

Automated marketing includes email campaigns, SMS notifications, and push notifications for app users, creating multi-channel customer communication without manual effort. The automation triggers based on customer behavior—lapsed customers receive win-back offers, frequent customers get VIP treatment, first-time buyers receive welcome sequences encouraging return visits.

Customer database and CRM capabilities track ordering history, preferences, and contact information, building knowledge enabling personalized service and targeted marketing. You know Sarah always orders gluten-free pasta with extra vegetables on Tuesday evenings, letting you proactively suggest new menu items matching her demonstrated preferences.

Reporting and analytics track sales trends, popular items, customer acquisition sources, and profitability metrics informing strategic decisions. Data reveals whether Facebook advertising generates profitable customers or just one-time bargain hunters, whether delivery orders have acceptable margins after driver costs, or which menu items deserve prominent positioning versus retirement.

Pricing starts at $49 monthly with seven-day free trials, positioning UpMenu as one of the most affordable full-featured platforms. Users report increased orders and cost savings compared to third-party marketplace dependency, with Capterra ratings of 4.7/5 reflecting customer satisfaction.

## **[GloriaFood](https://www.gloriafood.com)**

Free basic system with built-in kitchen display, loyalty programs, and pay-per-feature advanced options.

![GloriaFood Screenshot](/gloriafood.webp)


GloriaFood offers genuinely free basic online ordering functionality helping beginning restaurants or tight-budget operations establish direct ordering without upfront investment. The free tier includes online ordering through websites or Facebook pages, menu management, order tracking, and basic customer data management—fundamentals needed to start capturing direct orders immediately.

Built-in kitchen display system organizes incoming orders digitally, eliminating handwritten tickets and the miscommunication plaguing busy kitchens. Orders print automatically to kitchen stations or display on screens with color coding, timing, and modification highlighting ensuring accuracy even during chaotic rushes.

Marketing features in paid tiers include email campaigns and loyalty programs driving repeat business. While the free version provides ordering infrastructure, growth-focused restaurants eventually upgrade for customer retention tools proven to increase lifetime value through systematic engagement rather than hoping customers remember you exist.

The perpetually free nature means restaurants testing direct ordering or operating on minimal budgets can access commission-free ordering infrastructure without monthly fees, though essential growth features like mobile apps, advanced marketing, and POS integrations require paid upgrades. This freemium model works for specific scenarios—starting restaurants testing viability or very small operations with minimal order volumes—but limitations push growing restaurants toward paid platforms offering comprehensive features in base subscriptions.

Customer ratings of 4.6/10 reflect the reality that genuinely free services compromise on features, support, and polish. You get functional basic ordering but not the refined experience, robust integrations, or responsive support that paid platforms deliver.

## **[Sauce](https://www.getsauce.com)**

Commission-free delivery management with fully-managed driver networks and customer engagement tools.

![Sauce Screenshot](/getsauce.webp)


Sauce tackles the delivery problem specifically—restaurants want to offer delivery without third-party marketplace exploitation but managing driver fleets and delivery logistics creates operational headaches they lack expertise handling. Sauce provides commission-free ordering plus fully-managed delivery including driver networks, routing optimization, and customer communication.

The fully-managed delivery service means Sauce coordinates drivers, handles logistics, manages customer issues, and takes responsibility for delivery experience while restaurants focus on food preparation. This managed approach contrasts with platforms merely providing ordering technology but leaving delivery logistics entirely to restaurants lacking infrastructure or experience managing delivery operations efficiently.

Customer engagement tools help build direct relationships and encourage repeat ordering through loyalty programs, targeted promotions, and automated marketing communications. The platform recognizes that converting third-party marketplace customers into direct customers requires systematic incentives and communication strategies, not just hoping they discover your ordering site.

Commission-free structure protects profit margins while providing delivery capabilities—restaurants avoid 25-30% marketplace fees while offering delivery convenience customers expect. The economics work because Sauce charges manageable flat fees or per-order costs significantly below percentage-based marketplace commission structures that scale painfully as order values increase.

Marketing support helps restaurants promote direct ordering and wean customers off third-party marketplace dependency through strategic campaigns emphasizing benefits like exclusive deals, faster service, or loyalty rewards only available through direct channels. This transition requires active effort—customers habituated to marketplace convenience need compelling reasons to change behavior.

Pricing details weren't prominently disclosed but the fully-managed delivery service typically costs more than ordering-only platforms due to operational complexity managing driver networks, though still substantially below third-party marketplace commission rates.

## **[Owner.com](https://www.owner.com)**

No-commission delivery with integrated POS, business banking, and unified restaurant operations platform.

![Owner.com Screenshot](/owner.webp)


Owner.com provides comprehensive restaurant technology ecosystem integrating online ordering, POS systems, business banking, and operational tools into unified platform managing multiple business functions through single provider. This integration streamlines operations by connecting ordering, payment processing, inventory management, accounting, and banking rather than forcing restaurants to cobble together disparate systems requiring manual reconciliation.

No-commission delivery protects margins while offering customer-expected delivery convenience. The delivery management handles logistics, driver coordination, and customer communication without extracting percentage-based fees that destroy profitability on delivery orders.

Business banking integration through Owner provides financial services designed for restaurant operations including faster payment processing, lower fees, and accounting integration simplifying tax preparation and financial management. This restaurant-specific banking understands seasonal cash flow patterns, tip management complexities, and payroll needs differing from generic business banking.

The unified platform reduces software subscription sprawl and administrative burden managing multiple vendors, contracts, and technical integrations. Single provider simplicity particularly appeals to restaurant owners who want technology enabling rather than complicating operations—they're restaurateurs first, not IT managers.

POS integration ensures seamless order flow from online ordering through kitchen preparation to customer delivery without manual re-entry or data synchronization issues plaguing disconnected systems. Orders placed online automatically appear in kitchen displays and update inventory systems in real-time.

Pricing structures weren't clearly disclosed but comprehensive integrated platforms typically charge more than single-function ordering systems due to broader feature sets and integrated banking/payment processing components. The value proposition depends on whether unified platform benefits justify potentially higher overall technology costs versus assembling best-of-breed specialized tools.

## **[Square for Restaurants](https://squareup.com/us/en/online-ordering)**

Integrated ordering with payment processing, POS systems, and free basic plans scaling to paid features.

![Square for Restaurants Screenshot](/squareup.webp)

These percentage-based fees remain consistent regardless of order size, making costs predictable for budgeting and financial planning.

Payment processor reliability leveraging Square's massive infrastructure and decade-plus operating history provides confidence in system uptime, security, and regulatory compliance. Square processes billions in payments annually with proven track record and institutional knowledge handling complex payment scenarios, fraud prevention, and compliance requirements.

## FAQ

**Are commission-free ordering platforms actually cheaper than DoorDash and Uber Eats overall?**

Yes, commission-free platforms deliver dramatically lower costs for most restaurants despite monthly subscription fees. Third-party marketplaces charge 15-30% per order plus additional service fees, delivery fees, and payment processing costs. A restaurant processing $20,000 monthly in delivery orders through DoorDash at 28% commission pays $5,600 monthly in fees alone. OrderDive at $139 monthly or ChowNow at $139 monthly costs 97-98% less while keeping 100% of revenue. Even accounting for marketing costs driving customers to direct ordering, the math favors commission-free platforms overwhelmingly once you surpass 3-5 orders daily. The exception is brand-new restaurants with zero existing customer base needing marketplace discovery, but even they should transition to direct ordering as customer relationships develop.

**How do I convince customers to order directly instead of using DoorDash or Uber Eats?**

Convert customers through systematic incentives making direct ordering obviously better than marketplace alternatives. Offer exclusive discounts unavailable on third-party apps—10% off direct orders, free delivery over $25, or loyalty points redeemable for free items. Communicate these benefits through in-store signage, receipt inserts, social media, and email campaigns to existing customers. Emphasize faster service through direct ordering since you prioritize your own orders over marketplace orders arriving through tablets competing for kitchen attention. Highlight that direct ordering supports the restaurant directly rather than enriching tech companies. Most customers genuinely want supporting local businesses when convenient—your job is making direct ordering equally convenient through user-friendly ordering systems like OrderDive or BentoBox that match marketplace ease while adding incentive layers marketplaces can't offer.

**Can I use commission-free ordering systems alongside DoorDash for additional reach?**

Yes, hybrid approaches work for many restaurants using direct ordering for existing customers while maintaining marketplace presence for discovery. Configure marketplace tablets to deprioritize or add preparation time so direct orders receive priority, incentivizing customers to switch channels. Some restaurants price menu items 15-20% higher on marketplaces to offset commission costs, making direct ordering the better value. However, marketplace contracts often prohibit significant price differences, so review terms carefully. The long-term goal should be gradually reducing marketplace dependency as direct ordering volume grows, but abrupt marketplace abandonment risks losing customers who haven't transitioned yet. Track metrics showing marketplace versus direct order profitability, customer acquisition costs, and lifetime value to make data-driven decisions about channel mix.

## Conclusion

Third-party delivery marketplaces extracting 25-30% from every order while simultaneously selling your customer data and promoting competitors represents the restaurant industry's most parasitic profit drain—what should be $10,000 weekly in delivery revenue shrinks to $7,000 after marketplace fees that could instead fund better ingredients, staff wages, or actual profit. Commission-free restaurant online ordering systems eliminate this exploitation by providing branded ordering through your own website and apps, keeping 100% of revenue, maintaining direct customer relationships for marketing and retention, and typically costing less monthly than two days of marketplace commission losses. [OrderDive](https://get.orderdive.com) specifically excels for restaurants prioritizing simplicity and control—zero-commission unlimited ordering for $139 monthly, instant menu updates without calling account executives, automated scheduling and timeslot management preventing kitchen overload, server-side rendering improving organic search visibility, frictionless ordering experience with industry-leading speed, and complete free access until you're ready to launch, making it ideal for restaurants finally ready to stop enriching marketplace shareholders and start keeping the revenue their hard work actually generates.
